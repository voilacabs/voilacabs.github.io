                    <button class="accordionQNA">SAAS (Software as a Service) Platform Architecture</button>
                    
                    <div class="panelQNA" style="padding-top: 15px;">
                        <p>Software as a service is a software licensing and delivery model in which we are issuing license on a subscription basis and is centrally hosted. Customer has full access to all of their data and mobile apps.</p>
                    </div>

                    <button class="accordionQNA">Whatâ€™s White labelled with SaaS ?</button>
                    
                    <div class="panelQNA" style="padding-top: 15px;">
                        <p>In this model we re-skin both Driver App (iOS & Android ), User App (iOS & Android ) and Website ( User ) and upload this appâ€™s on your accountâ€™s . Their backendâ€™s are hosted with US how ever userâ€™s who will download the appâ€™s can see your logoâ€™s and brand. There is no headache for maintenance as we take care of every thing.</p>
                    </div>

                    <button class="accordionQNA">What is 100% White labelled Model ?</button>
                    
                    <div class="panelQNA" style="padding-top: 15px;">
                        <p>In this model we hand over 100% source code and data( if you are our existing customerâ€™s ) and deploy the same to your serverâ€™s. This suits best for companies who has large fleetâ€™s and can afford to keep their development teamâ€™s.</p>
                    </div>

                    <button class="accordionQNA">Which model you should go for ?</button>
                    
                    <div class="panelQNA" style="padding-top: 15px;">
                        <p>If you are a small taxi company we advice you to go for normal SaaS model where you get Website ( with your brand and logo ) but hosted on your server . You get access to Driver app ( Voila Cabâ€™s Brand ). You get access to Admin panel ( With your brand and logo ) where you manage every thing to get your business going. You get access to dispatcher panelâ€™s ( Unlimited Dispatcherâ€™s ) With your brand and logo. And you dispatch jobs manually to driverâ€™s. This model has no set up cost and you pay for only number of driverâ€™s every month. ( Min. 10 Driverâ€™s )

                        If you are a large size taxi company and need User app as well then you should go for white-labelled with SaaS solution. Where we upload User Appâ€™s on your account with your brandâ€™s and logoâ€™s and your theme. Again with this model we take care of all your headache and all recurring cost and you need to pay us for only number of driverâ€™s every month. ( Min. 10 Driverâ€™s )
                        
                        If you are a development team and need full access to source code or want to move our of our SaaS model with your own set up, in this case we hand over complete source code and export data from our server to your server with on time installation support included.</p>
